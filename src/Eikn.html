				<h3>What is it about?</h3>
				<p>Eikn is a role playing game about creating a kingdom. Well, not necessarily a kingdom, more a gathering of sorts. 
				   If the players of a party wishes to never settle down on a certain geographical area of the world, then by all
				   means they do not have to. </p>
